      "Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "Depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest. Also called major depressive disorder or clinical depression, it affects how you feel, think and behave and can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems. You may have trouble doing normal day-to-day activities, and sometimes you may feel as if life isn't worth living.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than just a bout of the blues, depression isn't a weakness and you can't simply \"snap out\" of it. Depression may require long-term treatment. But don't get discouraged. Most people with depression feel better with medication, psychotherapy or both.\n",
      "\n",
      "Depression care at Mayo Clinic\n",
      "\n",
      "Symptoms\n",
      "\n",
      "Although depression may occur only once during your life, people typically have multiple episodes. During these episodes, symptoms occur most of the day, nearly every day and may include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Feelings of sadness, tearfulness, emptiness or hopelessness\n",
      "\n",
      "Angry outbursts, irritability or frustration, even over small matters\n",
      "\n",
      "Loss of interest or pleasure in most or all normal activities, such as sex, hobbies or sports\n",
      "\n",
      "Sleep disturbances, including insomnia or sleeping too much\n",
      "\n",
      "Tiredness and lack of energy, so even small tasks take extra effort\n",
      "\n",
      "Reduced appetite and weight loss or increased cravings for food and weight gain\n",
      "\n",
      "Anxiety, agitation or restlessness\n",
      "\n",
      "Slowed thinking, speaking or body movements\n",
      "\n",
      "Feelings of worthlessness or guilt, fixating on past failures or self-blame\n",
      "\n",
      "Trouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions and remembering things\n",
      "\n",
      "Frequent or recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts or suicide\n",
      "\n",
      "Unexplained physical problems, such as back pain or headaches\n",
      "\n",
      "For many people with depression, symptoms usually are severe enough to cause noticeable problems in day-to-day activities, such as work, school, social activities or relationships with others. Some people may feel generally miserable or unhappy without really knowing why.\n",
      "\n",
      "Depression symptoms in children and teens\n",
      "\n",
      "Common signs and symptoms of depression in children and teenagers are similar to those of adults, but there can be some differences.\n",
      "\n",
      "In younger children, symptoms of depression may include sadness, irritability, clinginess, worry, aches and pains, refusing to go to school, or being underweight.\n",
      "\n",
      "In teens, symptoms may include sadness, irritability, feeling negative and worthless, anger, poor performance or poor attendance at school, feeling misunderstood and extremely sensitive, using recreational drugs or alcohol, eating or sleeping too much, self-harm, loss of interest in normal activities, and avoidance of social interaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Depression symptoms in older adults\n",
      "\n",
      "Depression is not a normal part of growing older, and it should never be taken lightly. Unfortunately, depression often goes undiagnosed and untreated in older adults, and they may feel reluctant to seek help. Symptoms of depression may be different or less obvious in older adults, such as:\n",

      "Memory difficulties or personality changes\n",
      "\n",
      "Physical aches or pain\n",

      "\n",
      "Suicidal thinking or feelings, especially in older men\n",
      "\n",
      "When to see a doctor\n",
      "\n",
      "If you feel depressed, make an appointment to see your doctor or mental health professional as soon as you can. If you're reluctant to seek treatment, talk to a friend or loved one, any health care professional, a faith leader, or someone else you trust.\n",
      "\n",
      "When to get emergency help\n",
      "\n",
      "If you think you may hurt yourself or attempt suicide, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also consider these options if you're having suicidal thoughts:\n",
      "\n",
      "Call your doctor or mental health professional.\n",
      "\n",
      "Call a suicide hotline number — in the U.S., call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255). Use that same number and press \"1\" to reach the Veterans Crisis Line.\n",

      "\n",
      "If you have a loved one who is in danger of suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with that person. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Or, if you think you can do so safely, take the person to the nearest hospital emergency room.\n",

      "Causes\n",

      "It's not known exactly what causes depression. As with many mental disorders, a variety of factors may be involved, such as:\n",

      "\n",
      "People with depression appear to have physical changes in their brains. The significance of these changes is still uncertain, but may eventually help pinpoint causes. Brain chemistry. Neurotransmitters are naturally occurring brain chemicals that likely play a role in depression.

      "Neurotransmitters are naturally occurring brain chemicals that likely play a role in depression. Recent research indicates that changes in the function and effect of these neurotransmitters and how they interact with neurocircuits involved in maintaining mood stability may play a significant role in depression and its treatment.

Hormone changes can result with pregnancy and during the weeks or months after delivery (postpartum) and from thyroid problems, menopause or a number of other conditions.\n",

      "\n",
      "Risk factors\n",
      "\n",
      "Depression often begins in the teens, 20s or 30s, but it can happen at any age. More women than men are diagnosed with depression, but this may be due in part because women are more likely to seek treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Factors that seem to increase the risk of developing or triggering depression include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Certain personality traits, such as low self-esteem and being too dependent, self-critical or pessimistic\n",
      "\n",
      "Traumatic or stressful events, such as physical or sexual abuse, the death or loss of a loved one, a difficult relationship, or financial problems\n",
      "\n",
      "Blood relatives with a history of depression, bipolar disorder, alcoholism or suicide\n",
      "\n",
      "Being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, or having variations in the development of genital organs that aren't clearly male or female (intersex) in an unsupportive situation\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Complications\n",
      "\n",
      "Depression is a serious disorder that can take a terrible toll on you and your family. Depression often gets worse if it isn't treated, resulting in emotional, behavioral and health problems that affect every area of your life.\n",
